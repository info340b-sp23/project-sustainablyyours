                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                One previous attempt to solve this problem is <a href="https://earthhero.com/" target="_blank" alt="Website to earthhero.com">EarthHero</a>. EarthHero aims to sell their own sustainable products. Essentially, they are trying to be a clothing retailer, like Nike, Adidas, Puma, etc.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                However, the main problem we saw with this app is that they are only focused on selling their products. While this is still respectable as they are selling fully eco-friendly items, our main focus is to raise awareness for several companies with the same mission and goal as us. We want to include countless different eco-friendly companies and practices on our website to 1) increase awareness for those companies, 2) try to maximize our impact on the environment, and 3) create a better planet for future generations.,

                            While social injustices are the problems most worth attacking, your project could also address smaller, or more personal "problems". What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a web app might be able to help with?
                        </strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Although the problem we are aiming to tackle is not unique to us, it will still impact us, along with the rest of the population, long-term. We have noticed for years, and especially recently, a lack of awareness regarding eco-friendly products and sustainability. The worse and worse we, as a population, are at sustaining the environment, the sooner the ‘doomsday clock’ is to striking. Thus, we want to address the problem of poor eco-friendly measures and sustainable practices among the population. We aim to do this by creating a hub to find sustainable and good-practice products, such as eco-friendly clothing and accessories.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                The current problem is there is a lack of awareness about sustainable measures and eco-friendly policies. Currently, a large portion of teenagers do not pay attention to the health and overall well-being of the environment. The problem with unsustainable practices is that they compromise the ability of current and future generations to meet their needs, putting at risk the health and well-being of humans and other species. Unsustainable practices exacerbate poverty, inequality, and conflict, and threaten the stability of ecosystems and economies. It is critical to end unsustainable practices to protect the environment, safeguard social justice, and ensure economic prosperity. This requires a shift towards sustainable practices that balance the needs of people, the planet, and prosperity, and prioritize long-term wellbeing over short-term gain.

                                The users of the SustainablyYours.com website are likely to be individuals who are interested in sustainable products and eco-conscious shopping.

                                We will try our best to make sure the website is designed to be accessible to individuals with disabilities, ensuring that it adheres to web accessibility standards and guidelines. This can help ensure that people with visual, hearing, mobility, or cognitive impairments are able to access and use the website effectively.

                                In terms of inclusivity, it is important to consider the representation of minority groups in the products and brands featured on the website. The website should strive to showcase a diverse range of sustainable products from a variety of brands, including those that are owned or operated by minority groups. This can help promote inclusivity and equity in the sustainable marketplace, and support businesses that are owned or operated by underrepresented communities.

                                The main goal of the web app is for our users to learn where and how to buy eco-friendly and ethically sourced products from various online retailers. Given the abundance of resources available, shoppers may have a hard time finding the best sustainable product. Thus, with our app, we aim to let users have an easier and smoother experience buying such products. We want shoppers to come to our website, easily find sustainable products from the site, and help the environment one purchase at a time.

                                Our features for the app will be a “Search and Filter” feature, a “Wishlist” feature, and a “User Accounts” feature. In the search and filter feature, the user will be able to search for sustainable products based on keywords, categories, or other criteria. Additionally, they will be able to refine their search results based on various filters such as product type, brand, price range, eco-certifications, and more. This feature would involve user input to search and filter the products displayed on the website, enabling users to find specific sustainable products that match their preferences.

                                Next, in the wishlist feature, users will be able to create wishlists and add products to their shopping cart for future purchase. This would involve implementing functionality that allows users to save products to their wishlists or add products to their cart, enabling them to keep track of products they are interested in or ready to purchase.
                            </li>

                                Finally, users will be able to create accounts on your website, which would enable them to save their favorite products, create wishlists, and keep track of their purchases. This would involve user registration, login, and profile management features, allowing users to personalize. By creating an account, the user will be able to track their recent activity on the app so that their wishlist, favorite products, and purchase history is tailored to them and their interests.
