                                eco-conscious shopping. This can include environmentally conscious consumers,

                                anyone looking to make more informed and responsible purchasing decisions.

                                adheres to web accessibility standards and guidelines. This can help ensure that people
                                with visual, hearing, mobility, or
                                cognitive impairments are able to access and use the website effectively.

                                In terms of inclusivity, it is important to consider the representation of minority
                                groups in the products and brands featured
                                on the website. The website should strive to showcase a diverse range of sustainable
                                products from a variety of brands, including
                                those that are owned or operated by minority groups. This can help promote inclusivity
                                and equity in the sustainable marketplace,
                                and support businesses that are owned or operated by underrepresented communities.

                                The main goal of the web app is for our users to learn where and how to buy eco-friendly
                                and ethically sourced products from various online retailers.
                                Given the abundance of resources available, shoppers may have a hard time finding the
                                best sustainable product. Thus, with our app, we aim to let
                                users have an easier and smoother experience buying such products. We want shoppers to
                                come to our website, easily find sustainable products from
                                the site, and help the environment one purchase at a time.

                                Our features for the app will be a “Search and Filter” feature, a “Wishlist” feature,
                                and a “User Accounts” feature. In the search and filter feature,
                                the user will be able to search for sustainable products based on keywords, categories,
                                or other criteria. Additionally, they will be able to
                                refine their search results based on various filters such as product type, brand, price
                                range, eco-certifications, and more. This feature would
                                involve user input to search and filter the products displayed on the website, enabling
                                users to find specific sustainable products that match their
                                preferences.

                                to their shopping cart for future purchase. This would involve
                                implementing functionality that allows users to save products to their wishlists or add
                                products to their cart, enabling them to keep track of products
                                they are interested in or ready to purchase.

                                to save their favorite products, create wishlists,
                                and keep track of their purchases. This would involve user registration, login, and
                                profile management features, allowing users to personalize.
                                By creating an account, the user will be able to track their recent activity on the app
                                so that their wishlist, favorite products, and purchase history
                                is tailored to them and their interests.

                                For our project, we will be using a software called ParseHub which can scrape a lot of
                                product details and allow us to create the website that we are planning to
                                create. The software allows us to select all the products we want to list and puts it
                                into a spreadsheet and once we learn how to use React, we can easily transfer the items
                                from our spreadsheet to the website. Here is a super quick video: <a
